# Ollama Model Comparator

A simple yet powerful tool to compare responses from different language models running on Ollama.

## Features

- Compare responses from any two Ollama models side by side
- Track generation time and token count for performance comparison
- Support for custom system prompts
- Ability to add custom models not listed in Ollama
- Adjustable temperature and token settings
- Simple, intuitive interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) installed and running locally
- Required Python packages:
  - gradio
  - requests

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ollama-model-comparator.git
   cd ollama-model-comparator
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv comp-app
   source comp-app/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: comp-app\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install gradio requests
   ```

## Usage

1. Make sure Ollama is running:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

2. Launch the Ollama Model Comparator:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:7860

4. Select two models to compare from the dropdown menus. If your model isn't listed, add it in the "Custom Models" field.

5. Enter a prompt and (optionally) a system prompt.

6. Adjust the temperature and max tokens if needed.

7. Click "Compare Models" to generate responses from both models.

8. View the results side-by-side along with performance metrics.

## Configuration Options

- **Models**: Select from models available in your Ollama installation
- **Custom Models**: Add models not listed by entering comma-separated model names
- **System Prompt**: Optional instructions to guide the model's behavior
- **Temperature**: Controls randomness (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Max Tokens**: Maximum length of the generated response
- **Timeout**: Maximum time (in seconds) to wait for a response

## Limitations

- This version uses non-streaming API calls to Ollama for compatibility reasons.
- For very large responses, you may need to increase the max tokens and timeout settings.
- The app runs locally and requires Ollama to be running on the same machine.

## Troubleshooting

- **No models shown**: Make sure Ollama is running with `ollama serve`
- **Models not responding**: Check that the models are downloaded with `ollama list`
- **Slow responses**: Large models may take longer to generate responses; consider increasing the timeout

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add support for response streaming
- [ ] Implement more detailed comparison metrics
- [ ] Add export functionality for responses
- [ ] Support for comparing more than two models
- [ ] Chat history visualization
